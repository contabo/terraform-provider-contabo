  The Compute Management API allows you to manage compute resources (e.g. creation, deletion, starting, stopping) as well as managing snapshots and custom images. It also supports cloud-init https://cloud-init.io/ at least on our default images (for custom images you will need to provide cloud-init support packages). The API offers providing cloud-init scripts via the user_data field. Custom images must be provided in .qcow2 or .iso format.

# contabo_instance (Data Source)

The Compute Management API allows you to manage compute resources (e.g. creation, deletion, starting, stopping) as well as managing snapshots and custom images. It also supports [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) at least on our default images (for custom images you will need to provide cloud-init support packages). The API offers providing cloud-init scripts via the user_data field. Custom images must be provided in .qcow2 or .iso format.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure your Contabo API credentials
provider "contabo" {
  oauth2_client_id     = "[your client id]"
  oauth2_client_secret = "[your client secret]"
  oauth2_user          = "[your username]"
  oauth2_pass          = "[your password]"
}

# Search for a specific instance by ID
data "contabo_instance" "test_instance" {
  id = "123455"
}

output "my_test_instance" {
  description = "my test instance"
  value = data.contabo_instance.test_instance
}
```
